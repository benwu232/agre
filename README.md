# About AGRE(Accelerometer based Gesture Recognition Engine)

AGRE is an experimental project, which analyzes the motion data sampled by Wiimote to recognize gestures
of digits and some simple symbols.

The demo is here:

I finieshed this project in May, 2010, under Windows XP, with QT 4.x. The library wiiuse was used to transmit information between AGRE and Wiimote.

## Run the program

1. Connect Wiimote and you computer with Bluetooth. I use IVT BlueSoleil 5.0.
2. Run agre.exe and the GUI appears.
3. Select user in User tab.
4. (Optinal) Train gestures in Train tab.
5. (Optinal) Generate template, which used in recognition, in Template tab.
6. (Optinal) Select a template in Template tab, then recognize gestures in Recognize tab. 

Enjoy!
